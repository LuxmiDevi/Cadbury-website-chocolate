        <img src="./images/3.png" alt="" class="choco">
        <p>The Cadbury family founded their chocolate company in 1824 in Birmingham and later became among the first to sell milk chocolate that everyone could enjoy. When John Cadbury founded his company in 1824, he believed that chocolate could be a force for good in the world. The Cadbury family were pioneers of good business, putting people and communities at the heart of the way they made and sold their chocolate.
But this generous spirit didn’t stop there.
When Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate was first made in 1906 it was produced not just with a glass but with the equivalent of a glass & a half of full cream milk - and still is today.
We endeavour to live up to these founding principles of generosity in everything we do.
And we believe that this generosity of spirit is as important today as it's ever been. That while the world can often seem self-absorbed, if you look around you'll always see small acts of goodness from one person to another.
That’s why we say “There’s a glass & a half in everyone”.</p>
